      <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment
        setup

      <h2>Core components</h2> <p class="subtitle">Chapter 2</p>
      <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using
        React and
        the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
        platform‚Äôs
        APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:
        bundles
        of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first,
        let‚Äôs
        cover how components work in React Native.</p>

  <article class="chapter_3">
    <h2>React fundamentals</h2> <p class="subtitle">Chapter 3</p>
    <p>React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
      JavaScript.
      To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get
      you started
      or can serve as a refresher course.</p>

    <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:

      + components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
      approachable
      creatures that need names and a cafe to work in. </p>

    <p>+ JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
      JavaScript
      like so:
      < Text >Hello, I am your cat!< /Text >.</p>

    <p>The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because
      JSX
      is
      JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat,
      name,
      and
      embedding it with curly braces inside
      < Text >
    </p>

    <p>+ props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>

    <p>+ state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
      render, state
      is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes
      over
      time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

      <h2>Handling text input</h2> <p class="subtitle">Chapter 4</p>
      <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText
        prop that
        takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop
        that
        takes a
        function to be called when the text is submitted. </p>

      <p> For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a
        different
        language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the
        sentence
        "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
